## The game

Thank you for downloading!
We are developing this game as an assignment teached by Ricard Pillosu. This game is a platformer game where you will have to reach the end of the two levels in order to complete the game. Our character has the hability of sliding down through walls and jumping meanwhile.


## Core Subsystems

For the first assingment we used Tiled, for the creation of the maps, Tiled has also allowed us u create navigation and collision layers.We also learned how to save and load the game. Then we implemented the pathfinding system using A*.Later we learned how to cap Fps, and we used the tool brofile.For The third assingment we had to implement a UI system that provides the game of a menu.

## UI specifications

The game has a main menu, by pressing continue, a previously saved game can be played. The settings button allows the player to enable and disable VSYNC, credits can also be seen. When pressing ESC in game a menu opens, there you can save the game, go back to the main menu or closing it and keep playing.

## Debugging Fucionalities

* F1  Start from the very first level 

* F2  Start from the beginning of the current level

* F5  Save the current state 

* F6  Load the previous state (even across levels)

* F9  To view colliders / logic 

* F10 God Mode
